Welcome to the **IKEA Retail Sales SQL Project**! This project leverages a detailed dataset of millions of sales records, product inventory, and store information across IKEA's global operations. The analysis focuses on uncovering sales trends, product performance, and inventory management insights to assist in data-driven decision-making.

## Introduction

The IKEA Retail Sales SQL Project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze retail data, including **sales records**, **store performance**, **product trends**, and **inventory status**. Using a robust schema, this project answers critical business questions and provides actionable insights to optimize IKEA's operational efficiency and profitability.

---

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains SQL queries to create the database schema, populate tables, and perform analyses.
2. **Dataset**: Includes sales data, product information, store details, and inventory records.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries solve key business problems, leveraging advanced SQL techniques like joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

---

## Database Schema

### 1. **Products Table**
- **product_id**: Unique identifier for each product (Primary Key).
- **product_name**: Name of the product.
- **category**: Category to which the product belongs.
- **subcategory**: Subcategory of the product.
- **unit_price**: Price per unit of the product.

### 2. **Stores Table**
- **store_id**: Unique identifier for each store (Primary Key).
- **store_name**: Name of the store.
- **city**: City where the store is located.
- **country**: Country where the store operates.

### 3. **Sales Table**
- **order_id**: Unique identifier for each sales order (Primary Key).
- **order_date**: Date when the order was placed.
- **product_id**: Foreign key referencing the `products` table.
- **qty**: Quantity of the product sold.
- **discount_percentage**: Discount applied to the order.
- **unit_price**: Price per unit of the product at the time of sale.
- **store_id**: Foreign key referencing the `stores` table.

### 4. **Inventory Table**
- **inventory_id**: Unique identifier for each inventory record (Primary Key).
- **product_id**: Foreign key referencing the `products` table.
- **current_stock**: Current stock level of the product.
- **reorder_level**: Minimum stock level to trigger a reorder.

## Business Problems

This project tackles the following business problems:

### Easy-Level Queries
1. Find the average discount and total revenue generated for each subcategory across all stores.
```sql
SELECT 
p.subcategory,
ROUND(AVG(s.discount_percentage * 100)::numeric, 2) AS avg_discount,
ROUND(SUM(s.net_sale)::numeric,2) AS total_revenue
FROM sales AS s
INNER JOIN products AS p
ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY 1
```
2. Retrieve the top three products by total sales revenue in each store.
```sql
WITH t1
AS
(
SELECT
s.store_id,
p.product_id,
ROUND(SUM(s.net_sale)::NUMERIC, 2) AS total_revenue
FROM sales AS s
INNER JOIN products AS p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1,2
)
SELECT 
store_id,
        product_id,
        total_revenue,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY store_id ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS rank
FROM t1
limit 3;
```
3. Determine the product with the highest number of units sold in each category and store.
```sql
WITH t1
AS
(
SELECT 
st.store_id,
p.product_id,
st.store_name,
p.product_name,
p.category,
SUM(net_sale) AS highest_no_units
FROM sales AS s
INNER JOIN products AS p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN stores AS st
ON s.store_id = st.store_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5
),
t2
AS
(SELECT
t1.*,
t1.highest_no_units,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY t1.store_id,t1.category ORDER BY highest_no_units DESC) AS top_rank,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY t1.store_id,t1.category ORDER BY highest_no_units DESC) AS top_ranks
FROM t1
)
SELECT 
t2.category,
t2.store_name,
t2.product_name,
    t2.top_rank,
    t2.top_ranks
FROM t2
WHERE t2.top_rank =1
ORDER BY t2.store_id, t2.category;
```
4. Identify the best selling top 2 category of each month on the qty sold for 2023.
```sql
WITH category_sales
AS
(
SELECT 
TO_CHAR(order_date, 'Month') AS months,
p.category,
SUM(qty) AS total_quantity
FROM sales AS s
INNER JOIN products AS p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE 
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.order_date) = 2023
GROUP BY 1,2
),
category_ranks
AS
(SELECT
*,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY months ORDER BY total_quantity DESC) AS ranks
FROM category_sales)
SELECT 
* 
FROM category_ranks
WHERE ranks <= 3;
```
5. identify the store with decreasing revenue compared to last year.
```sql
WITH t1
AS
(
SELECT
store_id,
SUM(net_sale) AS last_year_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) =2022
GROUP BY 1),
t2
AS
(SELECT
store_id,
SUM(net_sale) AS current_year_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) =2023
GROUP BY 1),
t3
AS
(SELECT 
t1.store_id,
last_year_revenue,
current_year_revenue,
ROUND((last_year_revenue-current_year_revenue)::numeric/last_year_revenue::numeric*100, 2) AS percentage,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY t1.store_id) AS ranks
FROM t1
JOIN
t2
ON t1.store_id = t2.store_id
WHERE last_year_revenue > current_year_revenue
ORDER BY 4 DESC)
SELECT 
*
FROM t3
JOIN stores AS st
ON t3.store_id=st.store_id
WHERE ranks <= 5
ORDER BY percentage DESC;
```


### Medium to Hard-Level Queries
1. Determine the product category contributing the most to revenue.
2. Identify stores that need inventory replenishment for specific products.
3. Analyze monthly sales trends for each store over the past year.
4. Calculate the impact of discounts on total sales revenue.
5. Rank stores by their overall sales performance using window functions.

## SQL Queries & Analysis

All SQL queries developed for this project are available in the `queries.sql` file. The queries demonstrate advanced SQL skills, including:

- Aggregations with `GROUP BY`.
- Filtering data using `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
- Joining multiple tables to uncover insights.
- Using subqueries and window functions for complex analyses.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL (or any SQL-compatible database).
- Basic knowledge of SQL.

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ikea-sales-sql-project.git
   ```
2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Run `schema.sql` to create the database schema.
   - Populate tables with sample data using `data.sql`.

3. **Execute Queries**:
   - Open `queries.sql` and execute the queries for analysis.

## Questions & Feedback

Feel free to reach out with questions or suggestions. Here's an example query for reference:

### Example Query
**Question**: Retrieve the total sales revenue for each store in a specific country.
```sql
SELECT 
    s.store_name, 
    SUM(sales.qty * sales.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    sales
JOIN 
    stores s ON sales.store_id = s.store_id
WHERE 
    s.country = 'USA'
GROUP BY 
    s.store_name
ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC;
```
